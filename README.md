# ESO-Code
Jupyter notebooks for final year project 'Valuing employee stock options'.

'Analytic Formulae' implements analytic expresssions for ESO prices as derived by Cvitanic, Jaksa et al. in 'Analytic Pricing of Employee Stock Options'.

The remaining code implements a Monte Carlo estimate of ESO prices. The cases B, C and D correspond to sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 of the report respectively.
